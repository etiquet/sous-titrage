In particular, Sample #	does not cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, #	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of #	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.##	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh #	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be #	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, #	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may #	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not #	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.##	We recommend that you review this program or TESample before #	beginning a new application.#    NOTE: The Asm has warnings turned off here.  This is because the#    Macro "Case#" builds a list of BEQ instructions that could be#    optimized into BEQ.S.  Everyone of these causes a warning#    message to appear while building this sample.  With warnings#    turned off, they don't appear.  Code generation is NOT effected.# If ANY changes are made to the include file, you MUST perform# a full build of ALL source files.  The dependencies below will# cause all source file to be assembled if the Sample.inc1.a is updated.COptions		= -sym off -mc68030AOptions		= -w -t -sym off -d demo equ trueAObjs			= 		BB.main.a.o 		BB.HighLevelEvent.a.o			BB.UndoRedo.a.o 		BB.Rendering.a.o 		BB.conversions.a.o 		BB.Liste.a.o 		BB.Insert.Delete.a.o 		BB.Misc.a.o 		BB.Saisie.a.o 		BB.Affichage.a.o 		BB.TELECOMMANDE.a.o 		BB.Impression.a.o 		BB.RoutinesC.c.o			"{Libraries}"Runtime.o 		"{Libraries}"Interface.o 		"{Libraries}"ToolLibs.o  		"{Libraries}"DRVRRuntime.o  		"{Libraries}"PerformLib.o 		"{Libraries}"E3ITF.o 		"{Libraries}"IntelligentLibrary.o 		"{Libraries}"ObjLib.o		BB.HighLevelEvent.a.o	컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.UndoRedo.a.o			컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Rendering.a.o		컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.main.a.o				컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.conversions.a.o 		컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Liste.a.o 			컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Insert.Delete.a.o 	컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Misc.a.o				컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Saisie.a.o			컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Affichage.a.o		컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.TELECOMMANDE.a.o		컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.Impression.a.o		컴 BB.make BB.Records.aBB.demo			컴 {AObjs} BB.make					Link -w -sym off -o {Targ} {AObjs}					SetFile {Targ} -t APPL -c 'Bbou' -a BBB.demo			컴 BB.r  BB.make					Rez -rd -o {Targ} BB.r -append
